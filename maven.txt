      -> Plugins    => features of maven 
                       -> core plugings
                       -> external plugins

7. How maven lifecycle works ?
   -> Termonology : Goal , Phases , lifecycle
   -> 3 Types of lifecycle :
      -> Default : 24 Phases
      -> Site : 4 Phases
      -> Clean : 3 Phases
   
   -> Phases : Different kind of stages of project 
               -> complie, test , package, install , deploy ...
   -> Goal : Used to trigger phases
               -> we want intstall to be trigger then - project start from first stage to till goal stage
   -> Plugins : Each phases has plugins

8. Understand termonologies in dependency : 
   -> GroupId : It is name of your company product
                -> microsoft -> 20 products -> each product has font and style common so make jar so it avaiable to all products
                -> ex. com.microsoft.software
   -> ArtifactId : It is name of your project 
                -> PowerPoint
   -> Version : It is version of your product
              -> Release : 2.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.4 => project stable
              -> snapshot : 2.0-snapshot,2.0.1-snapshot,2.0.4-snapshot  => project unstable under test

9. Types of package support by maven
   -> jar, war, pom, ear

10. what is pom.xml ?
   -> project object model

      -> local repo : c:\users\ajay\.m2
      -> central repo : https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/ 
      -> private repo : archiva, nexus, artifactory

13.working of maven repo :
   -> maven => pom.xml => find dependecy in .m2 local repo 
                       => if not find in .m2 then download from cental repo where you don't have your own repo  
                       => if not find in cental repo it search in private repo like nexus 

14. How maven interact with repo :
    -> $ mvn install : copy artifact to .m2
    -> $ mvn deploy : copy artifact to private
